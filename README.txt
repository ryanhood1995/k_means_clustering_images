The file is kmeans.py.  There are 4 total arguments that need to be entered into the command line.

1.) The file name.
2.) The number of clusters (Enter an int).
3.) The maximum number of iterations before the algorithm stops (if it hasn't already converged) (this also must be an int).
4.) The image path.

For example, in my case, I would enter:
python kmeans.py 5 20 "C:\\Users\\ryanc\\Dropbox\\CS 6375 - Machine Learning\\homework\\hw3\\Penguins.jpg"
